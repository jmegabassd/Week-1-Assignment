# Week-1-Assignment
Week 1 Assignment

What requirements did you achieve?
I believe each part of the website is wrapped in the correct semantic tags; I used section tags as the ultimate plan would be to link to a different page within the website with an article on the subject.
I used absolute positioning to place an image in the top left of the header, I also used position fixed on the header to keep in place and tried position sticky on the footer to keep in place.
I used flexbox to position the header nav links.
All images were implemented in the way I wanted.
I managed to create a back to top button
Implemented smooth scrolling
Added a background music track that plays automatically
Added social media icons to the footer with link placeholders (didn’t want to create a live link)

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I manage to achieve everything in a roundabout way… 
I wasn’t happy with how the back to top button worked and still don’t fully understand the formatting.

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Everything! lol
The back to top button although working I couldn’t implement in the way I wanted, I was trying to use flex to position and also float right, but in the latter it broke the page causing the body to be have more height, in the end I have run out of time this weekend to really dig into why but I will keep experimenting and try to understand. Also although I understand what flex is for I still don’t fully understand how to implement it correctly, this I will be looking at in more detail down the line.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

I started at around 07:30 on Saturday morning and took about an hour off for lunch finally giving up on a few things around 21:30 as brain had exited the head, decided to restart Sunday morning with a fresh look.
As my first endeavour into making a website I found this tremendously difficult, at first I over complicated everything for some mad reason wrapping everything in divs with IDs. I realised after a few hours that it was silly and removed them. I also had setup css with all these ID tags which as well seemed very overly complex. After thinking everything through I also trimmed these down and used more element selectors and class selectors only keeping the id for a couple of buttons.
I need to think about basic structure more at the start and not overcomplicate things. Also through all these changes I didn’t use git enough, this was due to trying to solve all the various issue that arose, I got bogged down in positioning things around the page and forgot to push…
I took and edited the pictures myself apart from the main background sheetmusic img, this was all very rough as I don’t have photoshop anymore, as part of one of my previous jobs I used to take photos of sunglasses and edit backgrounds to be see through.
I used an old piece of music I wrote for the autoplay track as I own the rights to it.
When I have time flexbox will be the next focus to fully comprehend, I understand the concept but not how to implement correctly, I think I just need to keep building sites and experiment.
